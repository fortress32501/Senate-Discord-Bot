# Senate-Discord-Bot
A Discord Bot that encrypts and decrypts created during a Hackathon

The bot works based on different commands that are input. The "/help" input prints all of the available commands, what they do, and how to format an input to work correctly. The "/cencrypt " command will encrypt the bot in Caesar Shift Cypher based on the the letter that the person puts after the command. For instance, "/cencrypt c Howdy" will encrypt Howdy with a c shift Caesar Cypher. If the c was a different letter it would do that as the shift. The "/cdecrypt " command will decrypt a message based on the letter input after command, exactly like the "/cencrypt " command. For instance, "/cdecrypt c Jqyfa" will decrypt Jqyfa to Howdy using a c shift. The last command is the "/mencrypt " command that encrypts something using Morse Code. For instance, "/mencrypt Howdy" will yield ••••---•---••-•--. The bot needs to run forever, so a raspberry pi 3 was setup as a mini desktop. The bot's code runs on the raspberry pi 3 so that it can work.
